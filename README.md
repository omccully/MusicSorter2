# MusicSorter2

"MusicSorter" was originally created in 2012. MusicSorter2 is a remake of the origial program with a better user interface and cleaner code. This program sorts music files based on their file attributes. Files are sorted into folders like so: <artist>/<album>/<song>.mp3. The file name (the "song" format) can be specified by the user to contain the track number, song title, album, or artist. If a file is missing the artist or album tags, the word "unknown" is used in its place. File names will not be changed of files with relevant attribute information is missing.
